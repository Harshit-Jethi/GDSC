<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="2.jpg" alt="image2">
<p>Greetings,<b>I'm Maya,</b> a seeker of beauty and meaning in the world of art.
     From my earliest memories, I've been<br> enchanted by the world of colors and forms. 
     Growing up in Mexico, I was surrounded by the picturesque landscapes of<br> Beauty and dreamy scenes, 
     which instilled in me a deep appreciation for nature's beauty.
<p>Painting became not just a hobby, but a way for me to capture the essence of the world around me and convey the
 <br>emotions within. It's a journey of self discovery and a constant quest to translate the intangible into the tangible. With
    <br>every brushstroke, I rediscover a piece of myself.</p>
    <P>In essence, I am driven to paint by a profound love for the world around me, 
        a desire to capture its beauty, and an<BR> unquenchable thirst for self-expression through the
         medium of art. Through my paintings, I hope to share a piece of<BR> my world and
          touch the hearts of those who view them.</P>

    <tr>
        <td>Every painting begins with an idea <br>or a spark of inspiration. It might<br> be a vivid dream,
             a fleeting moment<br> in nature, or an intense emotion.<br> I keep a sketchbook handy 
            to jot<br> down these moments of<br> inspiration, which often serve as<br> the foundation for my artwork.</td>
        <td>Once I have a clear idea, I begin<br> sketching rough outlines and<br> visualizing the composition. 
            This <br>stage is all about finding the right <br>balance, deciding on the color <br>palette, and mapping out the key <br>elements.</td>
        <td>Next, I gather the necessary art supplies, which include:

            <ul><li>High-quality canvas or paper</li><li> Brushes in various sizes and shapes</li>
            <li>Oil or acrylic paints (depending on the project)</li>
            <li>Palette for mixing colors</li>
            <li>Easels for support</li> <li> Solvents and mediums for
            blending and texture</li></ul></td>
